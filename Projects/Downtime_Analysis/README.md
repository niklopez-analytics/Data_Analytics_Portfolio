## üîç Key Insights & Analysis

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Efficiency Gap:** The current line efficiency of 64% is well below the target of 85%. Significant downtime across various categories is a major contributor to this gap.

- üîß **Top 5 Downtime Contributors:** The majority of downtime stems from mechanical issues and human errors. Addressing **Machine Adjustment** and **Machine Failure** alone would recover more than 580 minutes.

- üßç **Operator Analysis:**
  - **Mac** consistently ranks lowest in performance and is heavily involved in high downtime causes like **Batch Coding Error** and **Machine Adjustment**.
  - **Dennis** has the highest recorded errors in **Batch Change** and **Inventory Shortage**, which should be flagged for retraining or reassignment.

- ü•§ **Product-Specific Downtime:** The **CO-600** product is disproportionately affected by downtime, nearly doubling the next highest product (CO-2L). This may indicate issues with its production setup or complexity.

- üõë **Systemic Downtime Factors:** A combination of poor technical adjustment, insufficient training, and machine wear-and-tear are causing bottlenecks.

## üí° Recommendations

1. **Operator Training Program:**
   - Provide targeted coaching for **Mac** and **Dennis** on handling batch transitions and machine settings.
   - Reinforce Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and introduce visual aids near control stations.

2. **Technical Maintenance Review:**
   - Conduct a mechanical audit focused on **adjustment procedures** and **frequent failure points**.
   - Standardize machine calibration to reduce the need for manual intervention.

3. **Inventory Process Optimization:**
   - Investigate the root cause of **inventory shortages** and consider implementing real-time inventory alerts.

4. **Improve CO-600 Product Line:**
   - Review the **CO-600** production process for potential design flaws or bottlenecks.
   - Update training materials specific to CO-600 and run simulations to improve handling.

5. **Error-Proofing and Automation:**
   - Adopt **Mistake-Proofing** methods (e.g., checklists, alarms, interlocks) to reduce reliance on human judgment.
   - Integrate **Standardized Work Instructions (SWIs)** to ensure consistent operator performance.

6. **Batch Handling SOP Update:**
   - Revise the current batch coding and changeover processes to reduce complexity and downtime.
